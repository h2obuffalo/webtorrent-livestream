- Playback paused when backgrounded
- Resumes when returning to foreground

**Pass Criteria**: Stream stops immediately on background, resumes on return

#### Test 3.2: Lock Screen
**Objective**: Test screen lock behavior

**Steps**:
1. Start stream
2. Lock device
3. Unlock device

**Expected Result**: Stream paused during lock, resumes on unlock

#### Test 3.3: App Switcher
**Objective**: Test app switching behavior

**Steps**:
1. Start stream
2. Open another app (swipe up for recent apps)
3. Return to live stream app

**Expected Result**: Stream resumes from where it paused

### 4. Connection Indicator Tests

#### Test 4.1: WiFi Indicator
**Objective**: Verify WiFi icon displays correctly

**Steps**:
1. Connect to WiFi
2. Launch app

**Expected Result**: Green WiFi icon in app bar

#### Test 4.2: Cellular Indicator
**Objective**: Verify cellular icon displays

**Steps**:
1. Disable WiFi
2. Use cellular data
3. Launch app

**Expected Result**: Orange cellular icon in app bar

#### Test 4.3: No Connection Indicator
**Objective**: Verify offline indicator

**Steps**:
1. Enable airplane mode
2. Launch app

**Expected Result**: Red "no signal" icon in app bar

### 5. Error Recovery Tests

#### Test 5.1: Recoverable Error
**Objective**: Test automatic recovery from network timeout

**Steps**:
1. Start stream
2. Temporarily throttle connection to <1Mbps
3. Wait for buffering/error
4. Restore full connection

**Expected Result**: App automatically recovers and continues playing

#### Test 5.2: Fatal Error Handling
**Objective**: Test behavior with invalid stream URL

**Steps**:
1. Modify stream URL to invalid value
2. Launch app
3. Observe error message

**Expected Result**: 
- Shows "Stream not available" message
- Does not attempt infinite reconnection

#### Test 5.3: Retry After Multiple Failures
**Objective**: Test giving up after 5 attempts

**Steps**:
1. Ensure OBS is not running
2. Launch app
3. Wait for reconnection attempts

**Expected Result**: 
- Shows "Attempt X/5" for each retry
- After 5 failed attempts, shows error with manual retry options

### 6. Live Indicator Tests

**Objective**: Verify LIVE indicator appears

**Steps**:
1. Start playing stream
2. Check top-right corner

**Expected Result**: Red "LIVE" badge with pulsing dot

#### Test 6.2: Live Badge Persistence
**Objective**: Ensure badge doesn't disappear

**Steps**:
1. Play stream for 5+ minutes
2. Observe LIVE badge

**Expected Result**: Badge remains visible throughout playback

### 7. Performance Tests

#### Test 7.1: Long Playback Session
**Objective**: Test for memory leaks

**Steps**:
1. Play stream for 30+ minutes
