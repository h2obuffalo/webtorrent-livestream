# ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED: Deploy Stream Restart Detection

## What I've Done (Locally)

‚úÖ Implemented automatic stream restart detection
‚úÖ Added unique session IDs for each stream  
‚úÖ Reduced cache durations to prevent stale chunks
‚úÖ Created deployment scripts and documentation
‚úÖ Committed all changes to git (2 commits ready to push)

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (REQUIRED)

The code is committed locally but **not yet pushed** to GitHub. You need to push it:

```bash
# You're already in the project directory
git push origin feature/p2p-optimization
```

**If you get authentication errors**, you have two options:

**Option A: GitHub CLI (easiest)**
```bash
# Install if needed: brew install gh
gh auth login
git push origin feature/p2p-optimization
```

**Option B: Personal Access Token**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic) with `repo` scope
3. Copy the token
4. When you run `git push`, use the token as your password

### Step 2: Deploy to EC2

Once pushed, SSH to your EC2 server and run:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-ip
cd ~/webtorrent-livestream
git pull origin feature/p2p-optimization
bash deploy/deploy-restart-fix.sh
```

The deployment script will automatically:
- Pull latest code
- Rebuild broadcaster container (Docker) or update deps (PM2)
- Restart broadcaster service
- Show you logs and status

### Step 3: Test It

After deployment, test stream restart:
1. Start OBS stream
2. Stop OBS after 1-2 minutes
3. Wait 35 seconds
4. Check EC2 logs: `docker compose logs broadcaster | grep "Stream restart"`
5. Start OBS again
6. Verify viewers see new stream (not old one)

## Files Ready to Push

```
modified:   broadcaster/server.js              (restart detection logic)
modified:   broadcaster/r2-uploader.js         (reduced cache durations)
new file:   STREAM-RESTART-FIX.md              (technical docs)
new file:   QUICK-RESTART-GUIDE.md             (user guide)
new file:   DEPLOY-TO-EC2.md                   (deployment instructions)
new file:   deploy/deploy-restart-fix.sh       (automated deployment)
```

## What This Solves

‚ùå **Before:** Viewers stuck on last frame of old stream after OBS restart
‚úÖ **After:** Automatic restart detection, fresh stream within 10-30 seconds

## Quick Reference

- **Full deployment guide:** `DEPLOY-TO-EC2.md`
- **Technical details:** `STREAM-RESTART-FIX.md`
- **User-friendly guide:** `QUICK-RESTART-GUIDE.md`

## TL;DR

```bash
# Step 1: Push (on your Mac)
git push origin feature/p2p-optimization

# Step 2: Deploy (on EC2)
ssh ubuntu@your-ec2-ip
cd ~/webtorrent-livestream
git pull origin feature/p2p-optimization
bash deploy/deploy-restart-fix.sh
```

**That's it!** Once deployed, your stream restart issue will be resolved. üéâ
