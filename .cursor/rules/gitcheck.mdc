Always check which branch we are on in git before committing any changes

**CRITICAL**: Before committing, also verify deployment checklist:
- Docker services rebuilt if code changed
- Static files updated in all locations
- Caches cleared (Cloudflare, browser, Docker)
- Changes verified on live server
- No console errors in browser

See `.cursor/rules/deployment-checklist.md` for full details.
