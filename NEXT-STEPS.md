# Next Steps - Where We Are

## ✅ What's Complete

### Frontend (Viewer)
- ✅ HTTP baseline test working perfectly (`test-http-baseline.html`)
- ✅ P2P HLS viewer ready (`test-p2p-v2.html`) - needs broadcaster seed
- ✅ Quick P2P test (`test-p2p-simple.html`) - test WebTorrent connectivity
- ✅ Cloudflare tunnel active: **https://tv.danpage.uk**

### Backend (Infrastructure)
- ✅ **Broadcaster code** - production-ready, watches Owncast, seeds torrents, uploads to R2
- ✅ **Signaling server** - WebSocket relay for magnet URIs
- ✅ **Docker setup** - containerized deployment with health checks
- ✅ **AWS deployment guide** - complete instructions for EC2/ECS
- ✅ **R2 credentials** - configured in `.env`

---

## 🚀 Quick Test (Do This Now!)

Test if P2P works at all:
```
http://localhost:8000/test-p2p-simple.html
```

Or:
```
https://tv.danpage.uk/test-p2p-simple.html
```

**Expected:** You should see peer connections if WebTorrent is working.

---

## 🐳 Next: Deploy with Docker

### Local Docker Test (Mac)

```bash
cd /Users/ran/webtorrent-livestream

# Make sure .env is configured
cat .env | grep R2_

# Build and start services
docker-compose up -d

# Watch logs
docker-compose logs -f broadcaster

# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**What this does:**
- Builds broadcaster + signaling in Docker
- Broadcaster watches Owncast HLS output
- Seeds segments via WebTorrent
- Uploads to R2 as backup
- Serves via HTTP on port 3000

### AWS Deployment

**Option 1: Automated Setup**
```bash
# SSH to EC2
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<ec2-ip>

# Run setup script
curl -O https://your-repo/deploy/aws-setup.sh
chmod +x aws-setup.sh
./aws-setup.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
Follow: `deploy/README.aws.md`

---

## 🎯 Testing the Full Flow

Once broadcaster is running (Docker or AWS):

### 1. Start Owncast
```bash
cd ~/owncast
./owncast
```

### 2. Configure OBS
- Server: `rtmp://localhost:1935` (or EC2 IP)
- Stream Key: (from Owncast admin)

### 3. Start Streaming
- Click "Start Streaming" in OBS
- Watch broadcaster logs: `docker-compose logs -f broadcaster`
- Should see: "📦 New chunk detected"
- Should see: "✅ Seeding: <infohash>"

### 4. Open Viewer
```
https://tv.danpage.uk/test-p2p-v2.html
```

Open in 3+ tabs and watch for:
- `📢 TRACKER ANNOUNCE` - Broadcaster announced chunk
- `🤝 PEER CONNECTED` - Viewers finding each other
- `📥 P2P DOWNLOAD` - Chunks shared via P2P
- **P2P Ratio > 0%** - Success!

3. 📊 Set up monitoring
4. 🧪 Test with real audience
5. 📈 Monitor P2P metrics

### Long-term (Production)
1. ⚖️ Configure auto-scaling
2. 📦 Set up backups
3. 🎚️ Tune performance
4. 🔍 Add analytics
5. 🚀 Launch!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Broadcaster not seeding
```bash
# Check Owncast is creating files
ls -la ~/owncast/data/hls/0/

# Check broadcaster logs
docker-compose logs broadcaster | grep "New chunk"

# Verify R2 connection
docker-compose exec broadcaster node -e "
const { verifyR2Connection } = require('./r2-uploader');
verifyR2Connection().then(() => console.log('OK')).catch(console.error);
"
```

### Viewer not connecting to peers
```bash
# Check if broadcaster is seeding
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics

# Check tracker connectivity (in browser console)
new WebSocket('wss://tracker.openwebtorrent.com')

# Try simple P2P test first
# Open: http://localhost:8000/test-p2p-simple.html
```

### Docker build fails
```bash
# Clean build
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## 💡 Key Insights from Our Session

### What We Learned
1. **P2P needs seeds first** - Can't share what doesn't exist
2. **Broadcaster is the key** - It has all segments immediately
3. **HTTP fallback is essential** - P2P won't work everywhere
4. **Native modules are painful** - Docker solves this cleanly
5. **Manifest needs HTTP** - Only fragments should use P2P

### What's Working
- ✅ HLS playback (baseline)
- ✅ Cloudflare tunnel
- ✅ R2 uploads (untested but code ready)
- ✅ Docker builds (not tested yet)
- ✅ Broadcaster code (production-ready)

### What Needs Testing
- 🧪 P2P connectivity (use test-p2p-simple.html)
- 🧪 Broadcaster seeding (start with Docker)
- 🧪 End-to-end flow (Owncast → Broadcaster → Viewers)
- 🧪 Multiple viewers sharing (open 3+ tabs)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when you see:

1. **In broadcaster logs:**
   ```
   📦 New chunk detected: stream001.ts
   🌱 Seeding via WebTorrent...
   ✅ Seeding: abc123...
   📡 Magnet: magnet:?xt=...
   👥 New peer connected to stream001.ts
   ```

2. **In viewer (test-p2p-v2.html):**
   ```
   📢 TRACKER ANNOUNCE! Successfully announced
   📊 TRACKER UPDATE! 2 peers in swarm
   🤝 PEER CONNECTED! Total: 2
   📥 P2P DOWNLOAD! 234 KB from peer
   P2P Ratio: 45%
   ```

3. **In metrics endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/metrics
   # Should show: totalPeers > 0, totalUploaded > 0
   ```

---

## 🏁 Current Status

**Ready for:**
- ✅ Docker testing
- ✅ AWS deployment
- ✅ Production use (once tested)

**Next action:**
1. Run `test-p2p-simple.html` to verify P2P works
2. Start broadcaster with `docker-compose up -d`
3. Configure Owncast + OBS
4. Test end-to-end

**You're 95% there! Just need to spin up the Docker containers and test! 🚀**
