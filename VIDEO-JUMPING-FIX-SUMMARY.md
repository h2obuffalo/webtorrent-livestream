# Video Jumping Issue - Resolution

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🚨 Problem

Video was playing but jumping around after several minutes. Different players (Flutter, Firefox, Chrome) exhibited different skipping behavior.

### Symptoms
- Video would play for several minutes
- Then start jumping to different timestamps
- Each player/tab showed different jumping patterns
- Users on different devices experienced different skips

---

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Excessive Chunk Buffer (240 chunks)**
- Manifest was configured to keep 240 chunks (~24 minutes @ 6s/chunk)
- With out-of-order chunks, players had 24 minutes of disordered content
- Caused unpredictable jumping when players tried to find the next chunk

### 2. **Out-of-Order Chunks in Manifest**
- Chunks were being processed in correct order (536, 537, 538...)
- But manifest showed them out of order (536, 519, 528, 522, 534...)
- **Root cause**: Docker container was using cached/old code
- Sorting logic was correct but not being executed

### 3. **Source Map Errors** (Minor)
- P2P media loader files had source map references
- Actual `.map` files were missing
- Caused console errors (cosmetic issue)

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Reduced Chunk Buffer
**File**: `broadcaster/manifest-generator.js`

```javascript
// Before
this.maxChunks = config.maxChunks || 240; // 24 minutes

// After
this.maxChunks = config.maxChunks || 60; // 5 minutes @ 6s/chunk
```

**Impact**: Reduced manifest window from 24 minutes to 5 minutes, minimizing the impact of any ordering issues.

### Fix #2: Fixed Chunk Ordering
**Issue**: Docker container was using cached code despite file updates

**Solution**: Rebuilt Docker image to ensure new code was loaded
```bash
docker compose build broadcaster
docker compose up -d broadcaster
```

**Sorting Logic** (was correct all along):
```javascript
const sortedChunks = [...this.chunks].sort((a, b) => {
  const getChunkNumber = (filename) => {
    const match = filename.match(/stream-\w+-(\d+)\.ts/);
    return match ? parseInt(match[1]) : 0;
  };
  return getChunkNumber(a.filename) - getChunkNumber(b.filename);
});
```

### Fix #3: Removed Source Map References
**Files**: 
- `viewer/public/lib/p2p-media-loader-core.min.js`
- `viewer/public/lib/p2p-media-loader-hlsjs.min.js`

```bash
sed -i 's|//# sourceMappingURL=.*||' p2p-media-loader-*.min.js
```

## 📊 Before vs After

| Metric | Before (Broken) | After (Fixed) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Chunk Buffer** | 240 chunks (24 min) | 60 chunks (5 min) |
| **Chunk Order** | Random/Out of order | Sequential |
| **Manifest** | 783, 781, 767, 768... | 812, 813, 814, 815... |
| **Video Behavior** | Jumps after minutes | Smooth playback |
| **Source Map Errors** | Yes | No |

## 🎯 Verification

### Test 1: Check Manifest Order
```bash
curl -s https://tv.danpage.uk/live/playlist.m3u8 | \
  grep -E "stream-.*-[0-9]+\.ts" | head -10 | \
  sed 's/.*-\([0-9]*\)\.ts.*/\1/'
```

**Expected**: Sequential numbers (e.g., 812, 813, 814, 815, 816...)  
**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - Chunks are in order

### Test 2: Check Chunk Buffer Size
```bash
curl -s https://tv.danpage.uk/live/playlist.m3u8 | \
  grep -c "\.ts"
```

**Expected**: ~60 chunks  
**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - Buffer is within limits

### Test 3: Check Source Map Errors
Open browser console on https://tv.danpage.uk/test-p2p-branded.html

**Expected**: No source map errors  
**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - Console clean

### Test 4: Extended Playback Test
Watch stream for 10+ minutes on multiple devices/browsers

**Expected**: Smooth playback with no jumping  
**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - Video plays smoothly

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Docker Container Caching
**Lesson**: Copying files to the host doesn't update the Docker container  
**Solution**: Always rebuild Docker images after code changes
```bash
docker compose build <service>
docker compose up -d <service>
```

### 2. Buffer Size Matters
**Lesson**: Large buffers amplify the impact of ordering issues  
**Solution**: Keep buffer size reasonable (5 minutes is plenty for live streaming)

### 3. Debug Logging is Essential
**Lesson**: Without proper logging, issues are invisible  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive debug logging to verify sorting:
```javascript
console.log(`   📋 Manifest generation: ${sortedChunks.length} chunks`);
console.log(`   📋 First 5 chunks: ${sortedChunks.slice(0, 5)...}`);
```

### 4. Verify Before and After
**Lesson**: Always verify fixes with actual data  
**Solution**: Check manifest order before and after changes

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why Chunks Were Out of Order (Initially)

1. **File Watcher Triggers**: `chokidar` detects file changes asynchronously
2. **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple chunks processed in parallel
3. **Array Insertion**: Chunks added to array in processing order, not sequential order
4. **Sorting**: Sorting logic was correct but not being executed (cached code)

### The Sorting Solution

The sorting extracts the chunk number from the filename and sorts numerically:

```javascript
// Filename format: stream-VgTSJLRvRz-819.ts
// Extract: 819
// Sort: 812, 813, 814, 815, 816, 817, 818, 819, 820, 821...
```

This ensures chunks are always in sequential order in the manifest, regardless of processing order.
